# RhythmGameDemo
 Demo of a Rhythm Game I made for Music 323 class at the University of Dayton.
 It uses the DryWetMIDI Library to create a basic DDR styled rhythm game that can read Midi files.

# Get Started
 1. Open the project up in Unity
 2. Put your own midi file in the "StreamingAssets" Folder
 3. Put your music files in the "Resources>Audio>Music" folder (flac, OGG, or WAV preferred)
 4. Edit or clone the Rhythm scenes, and change the data in the "SongManager" object to reflect your song
 5. Have Fun
